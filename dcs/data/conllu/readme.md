# DCS in conllu format

## General notes

This is a dump of most of the texts in the DCS in a human readable, tab separated format. Most commentarial texts are not included in this dump.
The analysis of each string has been checked by one annotator.

The subdirectory ./files contains the texts in CoNLL-U format (see https://universaldependencies.org/format.html). Each text is in a separate folder, and each chapter (i.e. what is defined as chapter in the DCS) in a separate file.
The file name "Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā-0007-AHS, Sū., 8-1162" means: Text=Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā", chapter seven ("0007"), citation form of the chapter name="AHS, Sū., 8", chapter id="1162"
Note that format of the CoNLL-U files has changed in the latest release (Aug 9, 2022) and now conforms to the UD standard.

Current size of the dump:

* Number of lines: 670479
* Number of words: 5989632



Each line that begins with a number contains ten entries. The following list explains entries whose meaning is not the same as in the UD standard.

* 2. FORM: Word form or punctuation symbol. - A single string (= sequence of letters limited by spaces) can contain one or multiple words in Sanskrit. If it contains multiple words, the annotation follows the proposals for multiword annotation (https://universaldependencies.org/format.html#words-tokens-and-empty-nodes).
* 3. LEMMA: Lemma or stem of word form. - The lexical id of the lemma is found in field 11.
* 4. UPOS: Universal part-of-speech tag. - The value of this field is mapped automatically from the XPOS field.
* 5. XPOS: Language-specific part-of-speech tag. - This tag set is described in ./files/lookup/pos.csv and Hellwig, Hettrich, Modi and Pinkal (2018): Multi-layer Annotation of the Rigveda.
* 7. HEAD: If the chapter forms part of the Vedic Treebank, this field contains the line number (= column 1) of the syntactic head.
* 8. DEPREL: If the chapter forms part of the Vedic Treebank, this field contains the label of the syntactic arc.
* 10. MISC: This field can contain any combination of the following key-value pairs:
  * LemmaId: Matches the first column of ./files/lookup/dictionary.csv
  * OccId: the id of this occurrence of the word
  * Unsandhied: The unsandhied word form, "padapāṭha version". Univerbified preverbs are not resolved, but can be retrieved from the column 'preverbs' in ./files/lookup/dictionary.csv; only available for a part of the DCS.
  * WordSem: Ids of lexical semantic concepts. The Ids correspond to the first column of in ./files/lookup/word-senses.csv. A nicer form of these data is available via the [http://sanskritwordnet.unipv.it/](Sanskrit WordNet).
  * Punctuation ['comma', 'fullStop']: not part of the original Sanskrit text, but inserted in a separate layer.
  * IsMantra: true if this word forms part of a mantra as recorded in Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance.


## Directory 'lookup'

This directory contains lexicographic information (dictionary.csv), details about word senses (subfield WordSem in field 10 of a conllu line; file word-senses.csv) and a short explanation of the POS tags (pos.csv).
